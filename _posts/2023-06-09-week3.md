For the remaining 20 teams whose game posts are not takem in charge by the nfl_gdt_bot, I used keyword like "game day thread", "post game thread", "pregame thread", found poster users, and located channels to scrape the posts. Scraping is still going on. Meanwhile, I also start to write codes that interacts with gpt4 to do the annotation task.
