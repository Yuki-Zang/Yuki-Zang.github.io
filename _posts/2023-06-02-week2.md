title: Week 1-2

Over the last two weeks, I developed codes scripts leveraging the praw module to scrape comments from the reddits. I have succesfully gathered data for 8 teams thus far. I also look into codes that mask the entities and convert the raw texts into html files for online annotation. The upcoming task is to employ GPT for annotating the anonymized entities.
