For the remaining 20 teams whose game posts are not takem in charge by the nfl_gdt_bot, I used keyword like "game day thread", "post game thread", "pregame thread", found poster users, and located channels to scrape the posts. Meanwhile, I sampled 30 comments from panthers' dataset, masked/highlighted the teamname (as teamnames can be used as gold labels), and fed it into the gpt4 for model annotation. The accuracy for masked annotation is 75% and that for highlighted (unmasked) annotation is 84.38%. The accuracy is fairly high. The next step is to understand how human performs on this task.
